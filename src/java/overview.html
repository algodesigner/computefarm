The <i>ComputeFarm</i> project is a compute server framework for running compute-intensive
jobs in parallel. A {@link org.tiling.computefarm.Job} is a piece of work generated by
a client of the ComputeFarm, which the client gets the ComputeFarm to run using a
{@link org.tiling.computefarm.JobRunner}.
Typical <code>Job</code>s might be testing a large Mersenne prime candidate for primality, or ray-tracing
a scene from a cartoon movie.
</p>
<p>
The client divides the
<code>Job</code> into small pieces that implement the {@link org.tiling.computefarm.Task} interface.
Each <code>Task</code> is executed independently to produce a single result object, then 
the <code>Job</code>  combines the individual results into a final, overall result.
</p>
<p>
The underlying implementation of the ComputeFarm is pluggable. The only distributed
implementation at the time of writing is the one using JavaSpaces technology. If you want to
use this implementation then <code>Task</code> objects and the results they return after being executed
must also implement <code>java.io.Serializable</code>.
</p>
<p>
There is also a simple, local implementation of ComputeFarm which is handy for testing.
